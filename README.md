Hello. This website represents the theme of online courses. It has a homepage with a list of available courses and a list of students who were reformed students of this institution. The courses lead to a frontend development course which presents us with available topics of this course. The topic of Internet Theory may be accessed from there. On the other hand, the students' list gives access to the dedicated page of students, which leads to the page of a student who took a Frontend Developer Course. At last there is a page dedicated for the timetable of the studies and a map showing a location and another page for form. For JS part I made simple validation for name and email whose values are later shown in console.  
I didn't use any normalization tools (e.g. normalize.css) and just put padding and margin to 0.
As a main source for the idea of the website's courses and its topics I referred to the roadmap on https://roadmap.sh/ and https://roadmap.sh/frontend. The link is also in the reference list.
